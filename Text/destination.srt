00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:31,210
Little girl?

10
00:03:32,461 --> 00:03:34,337
I'm a policeman.

26
00:05:16,812 --> 00:05:18,980
I mean every woman I ever let have a key

27
00:05:19,147 --> 00:05:22,192
I swear to God it's like I come home

36
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:44,005
Then the same chick, mind you

48
00:06:16,702 --> 00:06:19,621
You sound just like my damn father!

60
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:47,564
Mm-hmm. Well.

62
00:06:53,486 --> 00:06:56,239
She's good-- she's good at turning off lights.

518
00:50:20,165 --> 00:50:23,710
Hello. Hello. Can anybody hear my voice?

516
00:50:14,243 --> 00:50:16,412
Anybody hears me, please respond.

517
00:50:18,872 --> 00:50:19,998
Hello, can you hear my voice?
